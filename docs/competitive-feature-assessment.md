# Competitive feature assessment (October 2026)

An exhaustive look at the other digital trunking scanner software and
hardware, what each one does in five areas — **scanning**, **trunking /
control-channel decode**, **audio quality**, **recording & playback** and
**encryption / decryption** — and where GopherTrunk had gaps. The gaps
that were tractable without a new on-air capture were closed in the same
series (section 3); the rest are listed with their blocker (section 4).

Sources were the projects' own READMEs, wikis, manuals and release notes
(October 2026); vendor and forum claims are marked. Nothing GPL was
ported — reference code was read for protocol facts only, per the repo's
standing rule.

## 2. GopherTrunk before this series — strengths and gaps

**Strengths no competitor matches**: TETRA TMO + DMO end-to-end
(bit-exact ACELP, neighbour cells, SDS-less but complete call following),
fifteen trunking protocols in one daemon including dPMR / EDACS / LTR /
MPT1327 / D-STAR / YSF, a first-party web console with call history and
playback, wideband multi-site decode, MRC diversity combining, offline
replay / siglab / cryptolab instruments, RadioReference import, hunt /
survey discovery, FLAC everywhere, per-call JSON + `.raw` / `.imb` / `.amb`
sidecars, Broadcastify / Rdio / OpenMHz / Icecast / webhooks, rigctld.

**Gaps found** (✔ = closed in this series, ○ = open, see section 4):

## 3. What landed in this series

Each item shipped with failing-first tests and, where it decodes air, a
reference pin rather than a capture pin (the #764/#771 rule — a synthetic
pass is not an on-air pass; the capture A/B recipe is named).

1. **P25 DES-OFB, Triple-DES and AES-128/256 decryption with operator keys**
   — `algorithm: des | tdes | aes` in `encryption_keys`; OP25's on-air
   frame layout (one cipher block discarded, then ADP's mapping) and the
   TIA LFSR MI→IV expansion, pinned by literal offsets and a transcription
   of OP25's expansion. [DMR & P25 encryption](dmr-encryption.html).
2. **`recordings.mute_encrypted`** — silence instead of vocoder noise for a
   call no key decrypts; sidecars keep ciphertext; `muted_frames` logged.
3. **Alerts** — `alerts:` rules (events × system / talkgroup / radio /
   emergency / encrypted / tone profile / duration / keywords, cooldown,
   templates) → Discord, Slack, ntfy, Pushover, Telegram, Gotify, webhook,
   exec, **MQTT** (QoS 0, optional full event mirror). Audio attachments on
   Discord / Telegram / webhook. `GET /api/v1/alerts`, channel test.
   [Alerts](alerts.html).
4. **Talkgroup hold + timed avoid** — engine, `POST/DELETE
   /api/v1/scanner/hold`, `POST/DELETE /api/v1/talkgroups/{id}/avoid`,
   Scanner + Talkgroups panels.
5. **P25 unit signalling events** — `unit.status`, `unit.message`,
   `call.alert`, `unit.ack`, `unit.queued`, `unit.deny`, `unit.function`
   (radio check / inhibit …), `unit.monitor`, with reason / function tables;
   CC Activity rows; alertable. [Events](api-events.html).
6. **Transcription** — `transcription:` posts recordings to any
   OpenAI-compatible Whisper server (OpenAI, whisper.cpp, faster-whisper,
   LocalAI); transcript on the call, searchable, exported, `call.transcript`
   event, keyword alerts. [Transcription](transcription.html).
7. **History search / date range / flag filters / CSV export**, **playback
   speed**, **sidecar retention**, **ALGID / KID in the JSON sidecar**,
   **`GET /api/v1/patches`**.

## 4. Still open, with the blocker

Ordered by value to a scanner operator.

| Gap | Blocker / why not now |
|---|---|
| **DMR Basic Privacy (16-bit) and vendor BP/EP (TYT, Retevis, Baofeng, Anytone, Kenwood, Connect Systems), DMR DES/AES** | Reference implementations are GPL (DSD-FME); the key schedules are not spec-published. Needs an independent description of each keystream construction plus a known-key capture, or the result is the self-consistent-synthetic trap. DMR Enhanced Privacy (RC4) is already in and capture-verified. |
| **P25 Phase 2 decryption** | OP25's TDMA path is marked experimental (7-byte frames, `PCW[6] &= 0x80`); the composer's Phase 2 chain also still fails the real-air MAC descramble (#915), so there is no verified place to hang it. |
| **TETRA SDS (text, LIP location) and D-STATUS** | Layouts exist in tetra-kit / osmo-tetra; worth doing, but GopherTrunk's SDS path needs a capture with known message content to pin — none is on hand. |
| **DMR LRRP / P25 Motorola & Harris unit GPS / SMS / data-channel decode** | The P25 PDU / SNDCP / IPv4 parsers exist but nothing feeds them; LRRP needs a data-call follow (T3 data grants are observed, not followed). Capture-gated. |
| **Site roaming / neighbour following** | Neighbours are decoded and displayed; following them needs an RSSI/decode-quality policy and a multi-site test rig. |
| **Close Call / Discovery mode, favourites & quick keys, location-based scanning** | Scanner-UX features with no decode risk; Discovery mode (auto-record unknown TGs) is the most requested — a design item for the next series. Priority-channel sampling landed as `scanner.priority_interleave`. |
| **Stereo / per-slot audio, start / drop tones, noise reduction** | Audio-path work; per-slot panning conflicts with the mono 8 kHz live stream contract and needs a web-player change too. |
| **Instant replay / live delay queue; Opus / M4A recordings** | M4A needs an AAC encoder (none pure-Go); Opus is a dependency decision. |
| **Talkgroup hold / avoid surviving a restart** | Deliberately session-only (a scanner power cycle clears them); conventional lockouts now persist by frequency in the `conv_lockouts` table. |
| **DMR Connect Plus / Hytera XPT, NXDN48, ProVoice & YSF audio** | All capture- or licence-gated (`docs/status.md`). |

## 5. Method note

Three research passes (open-source trunking suites; DSD lineage +
hardware scanners + PC control + call-sharing + general SDR apps; the long
tail incl. TETRA tooling) were cross-checked against two codebase
inventories (scanning + trunking; audio + recording + encryption) that
cite the implementing file for every feature, so each gap above is a
confirmed absence, not a doc oversight. The inventories also surfaced
stale package docs (`internal/radio/ltr`, `mpt1327`, `tetra/tetra.go`)
that describe gaps now shipped; those are a docs follow-up.
