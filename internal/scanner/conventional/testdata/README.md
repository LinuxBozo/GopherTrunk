# Conventional-scanner test fixtures

`ctcss100_radtel_447100k_48k.cs16` and `ctcss_none_radtel_447100k_48k.cs16`
are 1.2 s slices (3.0 s–4.2 s) of on-air captures posted by @v2maldo on
issue #1184: a Radtel RT-880G keyed on 447.100 MHz NFM with and without a
100.0 Hz CTCSS tone, recorded by GopherTrunk's per-call voice IQ debug tap
(RTL-SDR, 2.4 MS/s cs16, tuned on-channel). Each slice was channelized to
48 kHz (`dsp.NewResampler(1, 50, 401, 8.6)`) to keep the fixtures small;
`ctcss_realair_test.go` interpolates them back to 2.4 MS/s so the tone
detector runs at the rate the scanner feeds it.

Format: interleaved little-endian int16 I/Q, 48 000 samples/s.

`am_kric_126400k_carrier_48k.cs16` and `am_kric_126400k_noise_48k.cs16` are
1.2 s slices (0.1 s–1.3 s and 1.7 s–2.9 s) of an on-air capture posted by
@v2maldo on issue #1219: 126.400 MHz AM (KRIC Potomac Departure), recorded
by GopherTrunk's per-call voice IQ debug tap (2.4 MS/s cs16, channel at DC).
The transmitter is keyed for the first ~1.5 s of the capture and receiver
noise follows, so the two slices are carrier + voice and noise only, from
the same receiver at the same gain. Channelized to 48 kHz the same way as
the CTCSS slices. Used by `am_realair_test.go` (squelch) and by
`internal/voice/composer/am_realair_test.go` (carrier tracking).
